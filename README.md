# AI-Facial-Recognition-System

## Overview
This README documents the AI Facial Recognition System developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The project aims to enhance security measures by implementing a robust, AI-driven facial recognition system designed to unlock door mechanisms upon successful face identification.
## Features
* Face Detection and Recognition: Utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to identify and verify faces through a camera interface.
* Smart Lock Integration: Connects the output of the facial recognition model to electronic lock systems, enabling automated access control.
* User Interface: A web-based interface that displays attendance data, managed through secure login functionality.
## Technologies Used
* Programming Languages: Python and C++
* Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow for implementing deep learning models, and Firebase for real-time database management.
* Hardware: Utilized Nvidia Jetson Nano for processing and Arduino for managing lock mechanisms.
## Implementation
The system was developed in three major stages:

* Building the Recognition Model: Applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to train the system on a dataset of face images.
* Hardware Integration: Connected the AI model to electronic components and sensors for executing lock mechanisms.
* Interface Development: Created a user-friendly web interface to monitor and control access, as well as to review logged attendance data.
